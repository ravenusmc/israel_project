Ideas of what graphs to make: 
Filters - citizenship, event_location, date of event, gender, type of injury, killed_by

-Graph of average ages of people dying - Palestinian, Israel, combined - DONE 
-Graph of number of people dying. - DONE 
-Graph of where people are dying. - DONE
-Graph of people killed by month - date_of_event (May not do)
-Graph of looking at people who died who took_part_in_the_hostilities - DONE 
-Graph of the most common injurys - type_of_injury - DONE 
-Graph of most common ammunition used - Done 
-Graph of killed by - killed_by - 

#Ideas: 
#Should look at average age overtime. 

-Should I look at having a filter by killed_by?


-Do something with the date_of_event compared to the date_of_death - how long did it take them to
die. 




Column names: 
['name', 'date_of_event', 'age', 'citizenship', 
'event_location', 'event_location_district', 
'event_location_region', 'date_of_death', 
'gender', 'took_part_in_the_hostilities', 'place_of_residence', 
'place_of_residence_district', 'type_of_injury', 'ammunition', 'killed_by', 'notes']

Chat GPT Ideas: (May or may not use some of these)

The dataset contains the following key columns:  
- **Name**  
- **Date of Event**  
- **Age**  
- **Citizenship**  
- **Event Location**  
- **Event Location District**  
- **Event Location Region**  
- **Date of Death**  
- **Gender**  
- **Participation in Hostilities**  
- **Place of Residence**  
- **Type of Injury**  
- **Ammunition Used**  
- **Killed By**  
- **Notes**

Based on this, here are some interesting graphs you could consider creating:

1. **Distribution of Fatalities by Age Group**: A bar or histogram showing how fatalities are distributed across different age groups. This could highlight which age groups were most affected.
   
2. **Trend of Fatalities Over Time**: A time series line graph to visualize the number of fatalities over the years, months, or days, using the "Date of Event" column.

3. **Fatalities by Citizenship**: A pie chart or bar chart that breaks down the number of fatalities by citizenship (e.g., Palestinian, Israeli).

4. **Geographical Distribution of Fatalities**: A map or heatmap showing fatalities based on event location (district or region), which can help identify which areas experienced more incidents.

5. **Participation in Hostilities**: A bar chart showing the number of fatalities for those who took part in hostilities versus civilians.

6. **Gender Distribution of Fatalities**: A simple bar or pie chart visualizing the gender breakdown of fatalities.

7. **Cause of Death (Type of Injury)**: A bar chart showing the types of injuries that led to fatalities (e.g., gunfire, explosions).

8. **Fatalities by Perpetrator ("Killed By")**: A bar chart showing the distribution of fatalities based on the responsible party (e.g., Israeli security forces, unknown).

9. **Ammunition Used in Fatalities**: A pie or bar chart visualizing the types of ammunition that were involved in the fatalities.
