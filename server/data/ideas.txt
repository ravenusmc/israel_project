Ideas of what graphs to make: 
Filters - citizenship, event_location, date of event, gender, type of injury, killed_by

-Graph of common ages of people dying - Palestinian, Israel, combined 
-Graph of where people are dying.
-Graph of people killed by month - date_of_event
-Graph of looking at people who died who took_part_in_the_hostilities
-Graph of the most common injurys - type_of_injury
-Graph of most common ammunition used 
-Graph of killed by - killed_by

-Should I look at having a filter by killed_by?


-Do something with the date_of_event compared to the date_of_death - how long did it take them to
die.
